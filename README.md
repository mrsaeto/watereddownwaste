# Watered Down Waste
This game was made as part of a 48 hour hackathon. The theme of game was to create somehting nautical themed. We decided to make a game about the environment, we realized that it was the most pressing matter regarding ocean life, and decided to make a game to raise awareness.

**NOTE**: This game was made using the Unity game engine, and this repository only holds the game scripts from the game
